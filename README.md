# hello-world
i was recommended to do this so yeah

my name is Diana. I'm Internet freedom activist and online privacy fighter. I'm planning to stydy sociology in the University and to become a member of Pirate Party of Russia and RosKomSvoboda.

I like pizza, tea, sweaters and the Internet. Also I like watching cool and nice animated series (eg. Gravity Falls, Rick and Morty, Miraculous Ladybug etc.), Twin Peaks and playing League of Legends and Neko Atsume.

I'm looking forward to joining any movements/organisations/projects that's goal is to save privacy and anonymity online.
